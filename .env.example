# Gemini API Configuration
# Get your free API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
# Then create a .env file (copy this file) and set your key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# Note: The app will work without this (using default Karnataka carbon intensity)
# With the API key, it will dynamically calculate CO2 based on user's location
